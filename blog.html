                1. What is the difference between map, filter, forEach and find
                ?
              </h3>
              <p class="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
                map(), executes the same code on every element in an array and
                returns a new array with the updated elements. <br />filter(),
                checks every element in an array to see if it meets a certain
                criteria and returns a new array with the elements that return
                truthy for the criteria. <br />
                forEach(), is used to execute the same code on every element in
                an array but does not change the array and it returns undefined.
                <br />And The find() method allows you to check for the presence
                of a certain value in an array, in cases when you do not know
                its index. At the same time, it accepts various conditions for
                search criteria, which makes it possible to use it, including
                with complex functions.

                2. What is the difference between localStorage, sessionStorage
                and cookies ?
              </h3>
              <p class="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
                Local Storage is a network storage method that helps us store
                data on the client computer in the form of key/value pairs in
                the web browser.<br />sessionStorage - It is very similar to
                Local Storage. The main difference, though, is the lifecycle it
                persists in the browser until its current tab is opened.<br />And
                cookies - its data is exchanged with the server on every
                request. Servers can use Cookie data to send personalized
                content to users.

                3. How does the Event loop thing work?
              </h3>
              <p class="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
                The event loop is the secret behind JavaScript's asynchronous
                programming.JS executes all operations on a single thread, but
                using a few smart data structures, it gives us the illusion of
                multi-threading. And the event loop is what allows javascript to
                handle thousands and thousands of requests with just a single
                thread.

                4. How does the quizTimer (noChange.js) function work?
              </h3>
              <p class="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
                The quizTimer function displays the timer update of the HTML
                page using the global variable called 'timer'. The clearInterval
                method is used to stop the countdown by passing the timer
                variable, which holds the ID of the interval returned by the
                setInterval method and return statement is used to exit the
                quizTimer function. The modulo operator %. The result is
                assigned to a variable named mod. The formatted count is then
                displayed on the page using the innerHTML property of an HTML
                element with an ID of 'count'. If the count reaches 60 seconds,
                the The color of the count text toggles between two shades of
                red every second. <br />
                The setInterval method is used to execute this block of code
                repeatedly every 1000 milliseconds (or every 1 second) until the
                interval is stopped or the web page is unloaded. And this
                function is designed to provide a simple way to display a timer
                on an HTML page and customize its appearance.

                5. How does the chooseQuiz (noChange.js) function work?
              </h3>
              <p class="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
                This code defines a JavaScript function called chooseQuiz that
                takes two arguments: index and givenAns. <br />
                First declares a variable serial and initializes it to 0. <br />
                Inside the for loop checks whether the quiz question answers
                array already exists by using the find method to search for an
                element with a matching ID. If it is, the function updates the
                answer to that question with the new Ans value. <br />
                If it doesn't exist, a new QuizAnswer object is added to the
                Answers array with the Ans value. The new quiz object is created
                using the spread syntax to copy all properties of the
                quizData[index] object, and the givenAns value is added as a new
                property.
                <br />
                It uses a for...of loop and the splice method to find and update
                the answer object. <br />
                'push' method to add the new object to the array, and then calls
                the displayAnswers function to update the display.
