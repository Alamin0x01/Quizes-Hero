               1. What is the difference between map, filter, forEach and find ?
              </h3>
              <p class="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
                map(), executes the same code on every element in an array and
                returns a new array with the updated elements. <br />filter(),
                checks every element in an array to see if it meets a certain
                criteria and returns a new array with the elements that return
                truthy for the criteria. <br />
                forEach(), is used to execute the same code on every element in
                an array but does not change the array and it returns undefined.
                <br />And The find() method allows you to check for the presence
                of a certain value in an array, in cases when you do not know
                its index. At the same time, it accepts various conditions for
                search criteria, which makes it possible to use it, including
                with complex functions.

               2. What is the difference between localStorage, sessionStorage and
                cookies ?
              </h3>
              <p class="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
                Local Storage is a network storage method that helps us store
                data on the client computer in the form of key/value pairs in
                the web browser.<br />sessionStorage - It is very similar to
                Local Storage. The main difference, though, is the lifecycle it
                persists in the browser until its current tab is opened.<br />And
                cookies - its data is exchanged with the server on every
                request. Servers can use Cookie data to send personalized
                content to users.

               3. How does the Event loop thing work?
              </h3>
              <p class="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
                The event
                loop is the secret behind JavaScript's asynchronous programming.JS executes all operations on a single thread, but using a few smart data structures, it gives us the illusion of multi-threading. And the event loop is what allows javascript to handle thousands and thousands of requests with just a single thread.

              4.  How does the quizTimer (noChange.js) function work?
              </h3>
              <p class="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
                The quizTimer function displays the timer update of the HTML page using the global variable called 'timer'. The formatted count is then displayed on the page using the innerHTML property of an HTML element with an ID of 'count'. If the count reaches 60 seconds, the The color of the count text toggles between two shades of red every second. And this function is designed to provide a simple way to display a timer on an HTML page and customize its appearance.
