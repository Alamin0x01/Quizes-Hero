                            What is the difference between map, filter, forEach and find ?

                            map(), executes the same code on every element in an array and returns a new array with the updated elements. <br>filter(), checks every element in an array to see if it meets a certain criteria and returns a new array with the elements that return truthy for the criteria. <br>
                            forEach(), is used to execute the same code on every element in an array but does not change the array and it returns undefined. <br>And find(), returns the element itself that satisfies the condition.

                            What is the difference between localStorage, sessionStorage and cookies ?

                            Local Storage is a network storage method that helps us store data on the client computer in the form of key/value pairs in the web browser.<br>sessionStorage - It is very similar to Local Storage. The main difference, though, is the lifecycle it persists in the browser until its current tab is opened.<br>And cookies - its data is exchanged with the server on every request. Servers can use Cookie data to send personalized content to users.

                            JavaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop, which is responsible for executing the code, collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks.
